#+title: Asynthe's systems flake

This is my attempt at explaining and gathering all that I know about Nix,

These are links for my org notes.
I will try to keep them tidy and updated, but I don't promise anything.

I use Emacs and org-mode to edit the flake content, as a literate configuration.
You can see my personal use flake configuration [[https://github.com/asynthe/flake/blob/main/flake.org][here]].
